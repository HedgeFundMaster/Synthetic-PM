# Synthetic-PM
Synthetic PM Model (SPMM), blending systematic signals with real-world geopolitical/macro insight.
# Current Thesis 
Markets are not merely stochastic systems, but  historical artifacts shaped by narratives, institutions, and regime memory. By integrating a historian’s interpretive lens into quantitative modeling, this SPMM seeks to go beyond alpha decay and uncover persistent structural advantages rooted in cyclical and geopolitical pattern recognition.
